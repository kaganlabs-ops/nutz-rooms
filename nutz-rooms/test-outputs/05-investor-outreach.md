# Seed Round Playbook: $500k in 6 Weeks

## THE MATH WORKS
- 3k MRR → 36k ARR
- 20% MoM for 4 months = healthy growth
- $5M valuation on $36k ARR = 139x multiple
- With 20% growth, you'll hit $75k ARR by month 6

That's aggressive but defensible if you can show the growth is sustainable.

## YOUR REAL CONSTRAINT
3 months runway. You don't have time for AngelList spray-and-pray.

This is about relationships and speed. Cold email beats platforms every time when you're moving fast.

## MY APPROACH (6-WEEK TIMELINE)

### Week 1-2: BUILD THE LIST
□ 50 investors who write $25k-$100k checks
□ Focus on: pre-seed/seed stage, your industry, check size fits
□ Get warm intros through: customers, advisors, other founders
□ Cold email the rest with specific angle

### Week 3-4: FIRST MEETINGS
□ 10-15 first meetings scheduled
□ Demo the 20% growth story
□ Ask for intro to their network even if they pass

### Week 5-6: CLOSE
□ Follow up with interested parties
□ Create momentum with "others are interested"
□ Close 5-10 investors for your $500k

[Your name]

## WHAT YOU NEED BY FRIDAY
□ Deck (10 slides max)
□ Demo recording (2 minutes)
□ List of 20 target investors
□ Send 5 cold emails

## RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
That your 20% growth will continue. Investors will dig into this hard.

Be ready to explain:
- What's driving growth (product? marketing? word of mouth?)
- How you'll maintain it with more money
- Why growth won't plateau as you scale

## KILL CRITERIA
If you don't have 3 interested investors by week 3, pivot to:
- Revenue-based financing
- Smaller friends/family round
- Customer pre-payments

When I raised for Gorillas, speed was everything. Investors bet on momentum, not perfect decks.

Your growth rate is your weapon. Lead with it in every conversation.
