# Bet Thesis: Powerlifter Tracking App

## YOUR CORE BET
Powerlifters will pay $10-15/month for an app that tracks RPE, 1RM percentages, and periodization because current apps are built for casual users and serious lifters are stuck with spreadsheets.

## FIRST PRINCIPLES: WHY THIS COULD WORK
- **Pain is real**: You see it daily - people using spreadsheets in 2024
- **Willingness to pay exists**: They drop hundreds on belts, they'll pay for tools
- **Technical gap**: Current apps miss powerlifting-specific features
- **Engaged community**: Powerlifters are obsessive about data (good for retention)

## RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
"Powerlifters will actually PAY for an app vs. just complaining about free ones"

Everyone hates their current solution. Doesn't mean they'll pay for yours.
Maybe they like complaining more than paying.

## THE MATH YOU NEED
- 10 people talked to you. How many said "I'd pay $15/month for this"?
- Your gym has how many serious powerlifters? 50? 100?
- If you converted 20% at $15/month, that's what in monthly revenue?
- How many gyms like yours in your city?

Do the numbers. If your ONE GYM can't generate $500/month, this doesn't scale.

## KILL CRITERIA
You should stop if:
- Less than 50% of powerlifters you talk to would pay $15/month
- You can't get 10 paying users from your own gym in 60 days
- Strong or another app launches powerlifting features first

## DO THIS WEEK
□ Tuesday: Ask 5 people at your gym "Would you pay $15/month for [describe features]?"
□ Wednesday: Price test - ask 5 different people "$10 or $20/month?"
□ Friday: Find 3 powerlifting gyms nearby, talk to their strongest lifters

Don't build anything yet. When I built Gorillas, I delivered groceries myself before writing code.

For you: BE the app first. Track one lifter's programming manually this week. Text them their next workout each day based on their RPE from yesterday.

If they don't love the manual version, the app version won't matter.

**Ship deadline: If 7 out of 15 people say they'd pay, build an MVP by March 1st.**

The market is there. Question is whether they'll actually open their wallets.
