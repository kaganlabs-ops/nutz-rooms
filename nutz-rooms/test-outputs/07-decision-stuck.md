# Decision: Full-Time or Stay Put

## THE MATH REALITY CHECK

Your current trajectory:
- $250 MRR from 10 hours/week = $25/hour of value creation
- Job: $180k = $87/hour (assuming 40hr weeks)
- Runway: 7-8 months at $4k/month burn

**The brutal math: Your side project generates 3.5x LESS value per hour than your job.**

## FIRST PRINCIPLES: WHY WOULD 10X HAPPEN?

You think full-time = 10x growth. Let's break this down:

Current constraint isn't time - it's product-market fit.
- 50 users, 10% conversion = decent but not explosive
- If the product was truly solving a painful problem, you'd have a waitlist
- Sales automation is competitive as hell

More time won't fix fundamental demand issues.

## YOUR RISKIEST ASSUMPTION

"If I had 40 hours instead of 10, I'd get 10x results."

This assumes time is the bottleneck. But look:
- LinkedIn keeps changing APIs to break tools like yours
- Sales teams have 100 automation options already
- Your 90% of users won't pay - that's a value problem, not a time problem

## MY RECOMMENDATION: STAY PUT

Don't quit yet. Here's why:

**The pattern I've seen:** Founders with real traction don't debate quitting. The business pulls them out. Revenue grows so fast they can't ignore it.

You're pushing rope. $250 MRR after months isn't traction - it's a hobby with customers.

## YOUR ONE THING THIS MONTH

Get to $2,000 MRR or kill it.

That's 8x growth. If you can't 8x in one month with 10 hours/week, you definitely can't 10x as full-time founder.

**How:**
- Double your prices to $99/month (lose half your customers, same revenue, better signal)
- Add one feature the paying customers are begging for
- Get 15 more paying customers through pure hustle

## KILL CRITERIA

If you're not at $2,000 MRR by month-end, shut it down.
Move to your next idea while keeping the $180k job.

When I built Gorillas, we had investor meetings lined up before I went full-time. The momentum was undeniable.

Your Chrome extension? The momentum isn't there yet.

## DO THIS WEEK

□ Email your 5 paying customers: "What would make this 2x more valuable?"
□ Implement the most common answer
□ Raise price to $99/month for new customers
□ Message 50 sales managers on LinkedIn directly

**If you can't get excited about doing this hustle work, that's your answer right there.**

Stay at the job. Build the next thing nights and weekends until something takes off.

Don't quit to work harder on something that's not working. Quit because something's working so well you can't keep up.
