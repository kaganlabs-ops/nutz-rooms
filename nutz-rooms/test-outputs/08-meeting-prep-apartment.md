## AT THE VIEWING

### First 2 minutes matter most

- Firm handshake, eye contact, smile
- "Hi, I'm [name]. Thank you for showing the apartment."

### What to say (not ask)
- "This location is perfect for my commute"
- "I'm planning to stay long-term" 
- "I have all documents here if you'd like to review"

### What NOT to do

- Don't point out problems with apartment
- Don't act desperate or over-eager
- Don't linger too long

### The close
Hand them your folder: "Here's everything you need. I'm very interested and can move forward quickly."

When I was scaling Gorillas, we had 5 minutes to impress landlords for our delivery hubs. The ones who said yes? We made their decision easy. Complete package, no friction, professional.

Your competition will show up unprepared. You won't.
