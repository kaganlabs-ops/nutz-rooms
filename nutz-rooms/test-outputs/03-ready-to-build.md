# MVP SCOPE - SHIP IN 2 WEEKS

## IN (BUILD THIS)

**Core flow only:**
- Log today's workout (exercise, sets, reps, weight)
- Show last time they did that exercise 
- Simple suggestion: "Last time: 3x8 at 135lbs → Try: 3x8 at 140lbs"
- Basic workout history (list view, no fancy charts)

**Tech stack:**
- Simple web app (React + Firebase or similar)
- No mobile app yet - mobile web is fine
- No user accounts - phone number login only
- Manual suggestions (simple logic: +5lbs, +1 rep, whatever)

**That's it.**

## OUT (DO NOT BUILD)

- Social features (sharing, following, comments)
- AI coaching or complex algorithms  
- Progress charts and analytics
- Exercise library with videos
- Workout templates or programs
- Push notifications
- Native mobile apps
- User profiles or settings
- Export data
- Multiple users/gym partnerships
- Payment system (charge later)

## SHIP DATE: FRIDAY, TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY

Work backward:
- Week 2: Test with real users, fix obvious bugs
- Week 1: Build core flow, deploy somewhere
- This weekend: Set up basic infrastructure
- This week: Design the 3 core screens

## SUCCESS METRICS

After 2 weeks with real users:
- Do they log a second workout?
- Do they use the "last time" data?
- Do they follow the suggestions?

That's your validation. Nothing else matters yet.

## DO TODAY

1. Sketch the 3 screens on paper: Log workout, Show last time, History list
2. Pick your tech stack (don't overthink - whatever you know)
3. Message 3 of those 7 people: "Building this in 2 weeks, want to test it?"

The features you're not building? They can wait. I've seen founders kill momentum by building everything. You validated the core thing. Build the core thing.

Two weeks. Just the logging and suggestions. Ship it.
