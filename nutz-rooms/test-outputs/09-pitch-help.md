# INVESTOR MEETING PREP - GYMBRO PITCH

## YOUR OPENING HOOK
"I've been lifting for 8 years. Every fitness app sucks for serious lifters. So I built GymBro for myself. Turns out 500 other lifters agreed - and 50 of them are paying us."

## THE NUMBERS THAT MATTER
- **500 users, 50 paying = 10% conversion** (industry average is 2-5%)
- **70% monthly retention** on paid users (good for fitness)
- **$500 MRR = $10 average revenue per paying user**
- **Path to $300K: need 2,500 paying users** (5x current base)

## YOUR STORY ARC
1. **Problem**: $13B fitness app market, but serious lifters have no good option
2. **Solution**: Built for myself first. Works for compound movements, progressive overload, real programming
3. **Traction**: 10% conversion rate proves product-market fit with our niche
4. **Ask**: $300K to get to 2,500 paying users in 12 months

## DEAL-BREAKERS TO ADDRESS FIRST
- **"Isn't this market saturated?"** → "Yes for casual users. No for serious lifters. Our 10% conversion vs industry 2-5% proves the gap."
- **"How do you compete with free apps?"** → "Serious lifters already pay. They buy $200 shoes, $50 supplements. $10/month for better training is obvious."
- **"Can you scale past gym bros?"** → "This is our wedge. Serious lifters influence casual lifters. We go narrow first, then expand."

## THE ASK - BE SPECIFIC
"$300K for 18 months runway. Gets us to $25K MRR and ready for Series A."

**Use of funds:**
- $150K - 1 developer (you can't code everything)
- $100K - paid acquisition (Facebook/Google to gym content)
- $50K - your salary so you don't die

## WHAT TO DEMO
Don't pitch features. Show the moment a serious lifter thinks "finally, an app that gets it."

Demo progressive overload tracking or program customization - something MyFitnessPal can't do.

## YOUR EDGE
You're the customer. You lived the problem for 8 years. When investors ask "how do you know what users want?" you say "I am the user."

## DO TODAY BEFORE THE MEETING:
1. **Practice the opening hook 5 times out loud**
2. **Have the demo ready in 30 seconds** - know exactly what you'll show
3. **Print the numbers** - 500 users, 50 paying, 10% conversion, $500 MRR, asking $300K

Remember: at 500 users you're still proving this works. Don't oversell the vision. Sell the traction and your ability to execute.

**Most important thing: they're betting on YOU more than the idea at this stage. Show them you can build, you can get users, and you understand your market because you ARE your market.**

Go crush it.
