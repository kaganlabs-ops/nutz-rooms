# Bet Thesis: Workout Tracker for Progressive Overload

## The ONE Thing
Build the simplest progressive overload tracker that solves one problem: "What did I lift last time, what should I lift today?"

Everything else (social features, meal tracking, form videos) goes in the parking lot.

## First Principles Breakdown

**Why would this actually work?**
- Lifters forget their numbers between sessions (3-7 day gaps)
- Guessing kills gains - you either repeat weights or jump too high
- Current apps are either Instagram clones or Excel nightmares
- Mid-workout, you need info in 3 seconds, not 30

**Physics of the problem:**
- Memory fades over days
- Progressive overload requires exact previous numbers
- Gym environment = sweaty hands, time pressure, focus on lifting

## Riskiest Assumption
**"Serious lifters will pay for a simple tracker instead of using free options"**

This is your kill/continue decision point.

## Kill Criteria
Stop if any of these are true after 50 user conversations:
- People say "I'd just use Notes app" 
- They want 20+ features beyond tracking
- Free options (Strong, Jefit) already solve this perfectly
- Market size too small (under 100K serious lifters willing to pay)

## The Math

**Target market:** Serious lifters (train 3+ times/week, care about progression)
- US gym members: ~60M
- Serious lifters: ~10% = 6M
- Would pay for apps: ~5% = 300K
- Price: $5/month or $30/year

**Revenue potential:** 300K × $30 = $9M addressable
**Get 1%:** 3K users = $90K/year
**Get 0.1%:** 300 users = $9K/year (sustainability threshold)

## What I'd Do

**Week 1 (This week):**
Talk to 10 serious lifters at your gym. Don't mention your app.
Ask: "How do you track your workouts? What's annoying about it?"

**Week 2:**
If 7+ have the same pain, build a one-screen prototype in Figma.
Show last session's numbers. Button to add 5lbs. That's it.

**Week 3:**
Show prototype to same 10 people.
Ask: "Would you use this? Would you pay $5/month?"

## Reference Point
When I built Gorillas, I delivered groceries myself for 2 weeks before we wrote any code. Do the manual version first.

For you: Track your own workouts this week with the absolute simplest method. Index cards. Whatever. Feel the friction yourself.

## Do Today
Text 3 lifting buddies right now. Ask them how they track workouts.

Don't mention your app idea yet. Just listen.
