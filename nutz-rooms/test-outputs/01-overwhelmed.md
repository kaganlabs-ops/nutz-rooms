# Clarity: Your Real Situation Right Now

## WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING
- Consulting gig: $8k/month (real money, paying bills)
- SaaS product: $2k MRR, growing slowly  
- Course launch: idea stage, no revenue
- Co-founder pivot: their priority, not yours
- Investor meetings: next week, no prep done

You're treating all 5 like they matter equally. They don't.

## THE MATH TELLS THE STORY
- Consulting: $96k/year, proven
- SaaS: $24k/year, slow growth
- Course: $0, speculative 
- Pivot: $0, potential distraction
- Fundraising: Could be $0 or game-changer

**You have one real business (consulting) and four experiments.**

## MY TAKE
The investor meetings are your leverage moment. Everything else is tactics.

If you nail the raise, you can go full-time on SaaS and scale it properly.
If you don't, you're stuck juggling consulting forever while your SaaS stays small.

## YOUR ONE THING THIS WEEK
**Nail the investor meetings. Everything else waits.**

## DO TODAY
□ Write your 2-minute pitch: SaaS traction + growth plan + funding use
□ Prepare for the hardest question: "Why is growth slow?"
□ Get your numbers clean: MRR growth, churn, CAC, LTV

## DO TOMORROW  
□ Practice pitch with someone who'll be brutal
□ Prepare 3 scenarios: best case, realistic, worst case funding

## PARKING LOT (DO NOT TOUCH THIS WEEK)
- Course launch - park it
- Co-founder pivot discussion - "let's talk after fundraising"
- New consulting clients - minimum maintenance only

## KILL CRITERIA
If fundraising fails: go all-in on consulting, treat SaaS as side project
If fundraising works: drop consulting, scale SaaS

When I was raising for Gorillas, I stopped everything else for 2 weeks. Fundraising is binary - you win or you don't. Half-effort gets you nothing.

**First meeting is in 7 days. What's your pitch right now?**
