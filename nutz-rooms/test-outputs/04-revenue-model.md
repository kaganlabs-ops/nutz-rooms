# Your Path to $10k MRR

## THE MATH
- Current: 30 real users (weekly active)
- Target: $10k MRR at $29/month = 345 paying users
- Gap: You need 315 more paying users

## WRONG APPROACH (what most founders do)
Build pricing page → hope free users convert → wonder why nobody pays

## RIGHT APPROACH (what works)
Talk to your 30 active users first. They're already getting value.

## YOUR RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
"People will pay $29/month for what I'm offering"

You mentioned users want more AI credits and team features. That's not pricing research. That's feature requests.

Real pricing research = "Here's what I'm thinking of charging. Would you pay that? Why or why not? What would you pay?"

## KILL CRITERIA
If fewer than 3 of your 30 active users say they'd pay $29, your price is wrong.
If fewer than 10 say they'd pay anything, you don't have product-market fit yet.

## DO THIS WEEK
□ Today: List your 10 most active users
□ Tuesday: Call 5 of them. Script: "I'm adding paid plans. Current thinking is $29/month for unlimited credits plus team features. Honest feedback - would you pay that?"
□ Thursday: Call the other 5
□ Friday: Based on feedback, set your actual price

## LIKELY OUTCOME
Some will say $29 is too high. Some will say they'd pay $10-15. A few might say $29 is fine.

Go with what 80% of active users would actually pay. Better to have 20 users at $15 than 0 users at $29.

## AFTER YOU GET PRICING RIGHT
Then you optimize conversion. But you can't optimize what doesn't exist.

When I built Gorillas, we didn't guess what people would pay for 10-minute delivery. We delivered manually first, asked what it was worth, then built around that number.

Don't build a pricing page until you know the price.
