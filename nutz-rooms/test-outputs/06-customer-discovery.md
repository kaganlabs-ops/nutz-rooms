# Your Designer Validation Plan

## THE REALITY CHECK
You have one data point: your sister complains about existing tools.

That's not validation. That's a hunch.

Before you write a single line of code, you need to know:
- Do other designers have this exact problem?
- What's their current workaround?
- Would they actually PAY for a solution?

## FIRST PRINCIPLES
Why would a simple PM tool for designers work?

**Your bet:** Existing tools are overkill → designers want something simpler → they'd pay for designer-specific simplicity

**Riskiest assumption:** Other designers feel the same pain as your sister

**Kill criteria:** If 8/10 designers you talk to say "actually I love Asana" or "I just use spreadsheets and it's fine" - kill this idea

## DO THIS WEEK

**Today:**
□ Ask your sister for 3 specific Discord servers/communities where designers hang out
□ Message her: "Can you introduce me to 2 other freelance designers? I want to ask them about project management for 15 minutes"

**By Friday:**
□ Talk to 5 freelance designers total (including your sister)
□ Use this exact script: "I'm exploring tools for freelance designers. Walk me through how you currently track client projects and deadlines. What sucks about your current setup?"

**Target mix:**
- 2 from your sister's intros
- 3 from cold outreach in Discord/Twitter

## THE MANUAL TEST
Don't build anything yet.

If you talk to designers and they DO want this, offer to manage one designer's projects manually for a week. Be their PM tool. Use Airtable or a spreadsheet.

See what they actually need vs what you think they need.

When I built Gorillas, I didn't build the app first. I delivered groceries myself to understand what drivers and customers actually cared about.

## OUTREACH SCRIPT FOR COMMUNITIES

"Hey! I'm researching project management pain points for freelance designers. If you're a freelancer, would you be up for a quick 15-minute call about how you currently track client work? Not selling anything - just trying to understand the space."

Don't overthink it. Post in 2 Discord servers this week.

## MATH TO VALIDATE
If this is real, you should find:
- 50%+ of designers complain about their current setup
- They're paying $10-50/month for current tools
- They've tried 3+ different solutions

If you don't see those patterns, the problem isn't big enough.

**Your deadline:** 5 conversations by Friday. First one today through your sister.

Report back what you learn before you touch any code.
