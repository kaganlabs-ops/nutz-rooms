# MVP Scope: Podcast Scheduler

## THE ONE THING
Auto-schedule with Riverside room creation. Nothing else.

If someone pays $20/month just for this, you have a business.
If they don't, the fancy features won't save you.

## IN THE MVP
□ Guest picks time from host's availability  
□ Timezone conversion (automatic)  
□ Creates Riverside room automatically  
□ Sends confirmation email with Riverside link  
□ Host gets calendar invite  

That's it. 5 features. Ship in 6 weeks.

## OUT OF MVP (parking lot)
- Prep doc generation
- Guest questions workflow  
- Other platform integrations beyond Riverside
- Custom branding
- Team scheduling
- Analytics/reporting
- Mobile app

## YOUR RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
That podcasters will pay $20/month for 20 minutes of time savings.

Test this assumption BEFORE you build. Take 5 of your 50 people. Tell them MVP is ready in 6 weeks for $20/month. Ask for $100 upfront (5 months prepay).

If they won't pay upfront, they won't pay monthly.

## THE MATH CHECK
- 50 people said they'd pay
- Even if only 10% convert = 5 customers  
- 5 × $20 = $100/month
- Need 50 customers for $1K MRR

Are you confident you can get from 5 to 50? If not, raise your price or find more demand first.

## DO THIS WEEK
□ Message 5 of your warmest prospects  
□ "MVP ready in 6 weeks, $20/month, want 5 beta customers"  
□ Ask for $100 upfront commitment  
□ First message goes out today  

When I built Gorillas, we didn't build the full grocery platform first. We delivered from one store with bikes. 

For you: don't build the full podcast workflow. Build the one thing that saves 20 minutes. If that doesn't convert, nothing will.

Ship date: 6 weeks from today. Mark your calendar.
