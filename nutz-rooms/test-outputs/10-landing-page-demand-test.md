# Landing Page: BlogToSocial

## HEADLINE
**Turn One Blog Post Into 10 Social Posts**
*In 60 seconds. No brainstorming. No writer's block.*

## SUBHEAD
Paste your blog URL. Get instant tweets, LinkedIn posts, and Instagram captions that actually sound like you wrote them.

## THE PROBLEM (make it hurt)
You spent 3 hours writing that blog post.

Then you stare at Twitter for 20 minutes trying to think of one decent tweet about it.

You know you should repurpose content. You just don't have the time or ideas.

Meanwhile, your blog traffic stays flat because nobody sees your best work.

## THE SOLUTION
**BlogToSocial reads your blog post and writes social content that converts.**

→ Paste blog URL  
→ Get 5 tweets + 3 LinkedIn posts + 2 Instagram captions  
→ Copy, paste, post  
→ Done in 2 minutes  

No more staring at blank screens. No more "how do I say this differently?" 

## PROOF POINTS
✓ Matches your writing style (not generic AI voice)  
✓ Pulls the best quotes and insights automatically  
✓ Optimized for each platform (Twitter vs LinkedIn vs IG)  
✓ Ready to post or edit quickly

# MY TAKE ON YOUR APPROACH

Landing page is right. But don't just collect emails and disappear for months.

**DO THIS INSTEAD:**

## MANUAL VERSION FIRST
Before you build anything, BE the product.

1. Get 10 people to send you their blog URLs
2. Manually write the social posts for them  
3. See if they actually USE what you send
4. See if they'd PAY for this weekly

If they don't use your manual output, your automated tool won't work either.

## RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
People will actually POST the content you generate.

Lots of tools generate social posts. The question is: do people trust AI enough to post it with their name on it?

Test this manually first.

## KILL CRITERIA
If 8/10 people don't post at least half of what you send them, kill it.
If nobody offers to pay after getting free value, kill it.

## DO TODAY
□ Write this landing page copy (above)  
□ Set up simple email capture  
□ Message 3 solopreneurs you know: "I'm testing something. Send me your latest blog URL."

## DO THIS WEEKEND  
□ Manually create social posts for those 3 people  
□ Send it to them Friday, check if they posted by Monday  
□ If 2/3 post something, launch the landing page  

When I built Gorillas, I delivered groceries myself for 2 weeks before we wrote any code. The manual version taught me everything about what users actually wanted.

Don't build the tool until you've done this manually for 10 people.

Launch landing page only after manual validation works.
