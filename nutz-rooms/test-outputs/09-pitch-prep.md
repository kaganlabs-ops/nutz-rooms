# Investor Pitch: AI Code Review - Tomorrow's Meeting

## YOUR STORY (LEAD WITH THIS)
"We lived the pain at Google. I was tech lead for 40 engineers - code review was our biggest bottleneck. Manual reviews took 2-3 days, blocked deployments, engineers hated it. We built internal tools that cut review time by 70%. Now every company has this same problem, but no one's solving it right."

## THE NUMBERS THAT MATTER
- 500 users, 50 paying (10% conversion - that's strong)
- $2,500 MRR, 15% monthly growth
- Unit economics: $50/month average
- Built part-time while working full-time (shows you can execute with constraints)

## THE ASK
$750K pre-seed for 18-month runway:
- 2 senior engineers ($200K total)
- You full-time as CEO ($100K)
- Operations + growth ($450K over 18 months)

## TRACTION STORY
Don't just say the numbers. Tell the story:
"We launched 8 months ago with manual demos. First customer paid $200/month immediately - they were desperate. We've added features based on paying customer requests only. Our churn is under 5% because we solve a daily pain."

## MARKET SIZE (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- 10M+ developers globally
- Every team over 5 engineers needs this
- Current solutions (GitHub, GitLab) do basic checks, not intelligent review
- We're targeting the 100K companies with 10+ engineers

## WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING TOWARD
"$50K MRR in 12 months. That means 1,000 paying customers.
We know how to get there: 50% word-of-mouth (engineering teams talk), 30% content marketing, 20% direct outreach to engineering leaders we know."

## DEALBREAKERS TO WATCH FOR
- "Why won't GitHub just build this?" → "They could, but they haven't in 10 years. We're focused, they're a platform."
- "Market seems small" → "Every software company is our market. That's not small."
- "What about GPT-4 API costs?" → Have your unit economics ready

## CLOSE STRONG
"We're not building a nice-to-have tool. We're solving the daily frustration of every engineering team. You can feel the pull - 50 teams are paying us already, and we're part-time. Give us 18 months full-time and we'll show you what real traction looks like."

## DO TODAY (BEFORE THE MEETING)
□ Practice the Google story - make it visceral, not just facts
□ Have 2-3 customer quotes ready ("This saved us 10 hours/week")
□ Know your numbers cold: customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, churn
□ Prepare demo of your best feature (2 minutes max)
