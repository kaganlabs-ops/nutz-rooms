# Apartment Viewing Prep - Sendlinger Tor
**Today 2pm | Your dealbreakers first**

## DEALBREAKERS - ASK THESE FIRST
Don't fall in love with the place before you know these:

**1. Noise situation**
- "What are the neighbors like? Any noise issues?"
- "Is this a party building or quiet?"
- Walk around - listen for traffic, construction, thin walls
- **Red flag:** If they dodge the question or say "it depends"

**2. Budget reality check**
- "Is 1500 warm or cold rent?"
- If cold: "What are additional costs? Heating, internet, building fees?"
- **Math:** Cold rent + utilities usually adds 200-300€
- **Kill criteria:** If total is >1600€, walk away

**3. Balcony**
- You said you NEED this. Don't compromise.
- Check: size, direction (south = sun), privacy, condition

## SMART QUESTIONS TO ASK

**Internet (you work from home)**
- "What's the internet speed here? Who's the provider?"
- "Any connectivity issues in the building?"

**Lease terms**
- "How long is the lease? Any flexibility?"
- "When would I move in?"
- "What's the deposit situation?"

**The building**
- "How's the building management?"
- "Any major renovations planned?"

## WHAT TO DO THERE

1. **Be the annoying person** - knock on walls, test water pressure, check phone signal
2. **Listen hard** - stand quiet for 30 seconds in each room
3. **Take photos** - you'll forget details
4. **Don't show you love it** - stay neutral even if it's perfect

## YOUR DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Yes if:**
- Has balcony
- All-in cost under 1600€
- Genuinely quiet
- Good internet possible

**No if:**
- Missing any dealbreaker above
- Landlord seems sketchy
- Building feels chaotic/loud

## DO TODAY
Right now: Look up the exact address on Google Maps. Check what's around it - late night bars, construction sites, main roads. Knowledge is power.

**After viewing:** Message me immediately with the verdict. Don't overthink it - gut check plus dealbreaker checklist.

You got this. Be picky. There are other apartments.
