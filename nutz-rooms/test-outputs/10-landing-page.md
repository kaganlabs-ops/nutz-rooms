# Landing Page: Never Miss Your Next PR

## Headline
**Stop Guessing What Weight to Lift**
Your next workout, calculated automatically. No spreadsheets. No mental math. Just lift.

## Subhead
For serious lifters who want to get stronger, not just sweat. Finally, progressive overload that actually works.

---

## The Problem (Pain Points)

**You know you should progressive overload. But:**
- Forgot what you lifted last workout → lift too light, waste session
- Can't remember your rep count → guess wrong, miss gains  
- Spreadsheets are annoying → skip tracking, lose progress
- Other apps just log workouts → you still do the math

**You're serious about getting stronger. Your tools shouldn't hold you back.**

---

## The Solution

**ProgressLift tells you exactly what to lift today.**

Based on your last workout, it calculates:
- Exact weight for your next set
- Target reps for progression  
- When to deload vs push harder
- Your strength trends over time

**No guessing. No spreadsheets. Just lift what the app says and get stronger.**

## How It Works

1. **Log your workout** (30 seconds per exercise)
2. **Get your next workout** calculated automatically  
3. **Lift the numbers** we give you
4. **Watch your PRs climb** week after week

*Finally, progressive overload that runs itself.*
