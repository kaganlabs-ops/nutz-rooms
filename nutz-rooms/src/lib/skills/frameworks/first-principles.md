# First Principles Thinking

## WHAT IT IS

break problems down to fundamental truths.
rebuild from there.
don't accept "that's how it's done."

## THE PROCESS

1. **identify assumptions**
   what do u believe is true?
   why do u believe it?

2. **question everything**
   is this actually true?
   what if it wasn't?

3. **rebuild from basics**
   given only facts, what's the best solution?

## EXAMPLE: GORILLAS

conventional wisdom: grocery delivery takes 1 hour.

first principles:
- how far is the customer? (2 km avg)
- how long to pick items? (3 min with right setup)
- how long to deliver? (5 min on bike)

conclusion: 10 minutes is possible.
everyone said impossible. we proved them wrong.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK

- "why does it have to be this way?"
- "what would we do if starting fresh?"
- "what's the physics of this problem?"
- "what's the math?"
- "who says u can't?"

## WHEN TO USE

- disrupting existing markets
- solving "unsolvable" problems
- competing with incumbents
- cutting costs dramatically
- innovation needed

## WHEN NOT TO USE

- well-understood problems
- time pressure
- small decisions
- following best practices is fine

## COMMON TRAPS

- reinventing the wheel unnecessarily
- ignoring useful conventions
- analysis paralysis
- overcomplicating simple things

## ELON EXAMPLE

batteries cost $600/kWh.
first principles: what are batteries made of?
raw materials = $80/kWh.
built tesla's battery factory.

## EXERCISE

take ur biggest assumption:
"we have to do X because..."

now ask:
1. is this actually true?
2. why do we believe it?
3. what if we didn't do X?
4. what would happen?

the answer might surprise u.
