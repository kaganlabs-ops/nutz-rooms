# Growth Frameworks

## GROWTH EQUATION

```
Growth = Acquisition × Activation × Retention × Referral × Revenue
```

fix the weakest link first.

## PIRATE METRICS (AARRR)

### Acquisition
how do users find u?
- channels: SEO, ads, social, referral
- metric: visitors, signups

### Activation
do they get value fast?
- metric: completed onboarding, first action
- target: quick win in <5 min

### Retention
do they come back?
- metric: DAU/MAU, cohort retention
- this is where most startups fail

### Referral
do they tell friends?
- metric: viral coefficient, NPS
- word of mouth > paid ads

### Revenue
do they pay?
- metric: conversion to paid, LTV
- revenue validates everything

## GROWTH LOOPS

better than funnels — self-reinforcing.

example (content loop):
```
user creates content → content gets indexed → new users find it → new users create content
```

example (referral loop):
```
user invites friend → friend joins → friend invites their friends
```

## CHANNEL STRATEGIES

### Paid (fast, expensive)
- facebook/instagram ads
- google ads
- tiktok ads
- good for: validation, scale

### Organic (slow, sustainable)
- SEO
- content marketing
- social media
- good for: long-term

### Viral (unpredictable, powerful)
- referral programs
- shareability
- network effects
- good for: exponential growth

## NORTH STAR METRIC

one metric that matters most.

examples:
- spotify: time spent listening
- airbnb: nights booked
- slack: messages sent

everything should improve this.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- focusing on acquisition, ignoring retention
- vanity metrics (total users ≠ active users)
- no clear north star
- too many channels at once
- growth before product-market fit

## GORILLAS GROWTH

- started with flyers (10% conversion)
- word of mouth (it's magic)
- 10-20% week over week at peak

secret: the product was so good, people talked about it.
no amount of marketing fixes a bad product.
