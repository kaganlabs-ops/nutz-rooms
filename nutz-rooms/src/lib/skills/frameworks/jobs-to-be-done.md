# Jobs To Be Done

## THE CORE IDEA

people don't buy products.
they hire products to do a job.

milkshake example:
- morning commuters "hire" milkshakes
- job: stay full, not bored on commute
- competing with: bananas, donuts, bagels

## THE FRAMEWORK

**When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].**

example:
"When i'm building a startup, I want to talk to someone who's done it before, so I can avoid obvious mistakes."

## FINDING JOBS

### Interview questions
- "tell me about the last time u bought [product]"
- "what were u trying to accomplish?"
- "what other solutions did u consider?"
- "what would u have done if this didn't exist?"

### Look for
- the trigger (what caused them to act)
- the struggle (what's hard about current solutions)
- the progress (what outcome they want)

## JOB TYPES

### Functional
get something done.
"i need to track my expenses."

### Emotional
feel a certain way.
"i want to feel in control of my money."

### Social
be perceived a certain way.
"i want to look professional to investors."

## COMPETING SOLUTIONS

ur real competition isn't similar products.
it's everything solving the same job.

zoom competes with:
- other video tools
- phone calls
- in-person meetings
- email

## APPLICATION

1. identify the job
2. understand current solutions
3. find where they fail
4. build something better at that job

## COMMON MISTAKES

- focusing on features not jobs
- assuming u know the job
- ignoring emotional/social jobs
- narrow view of competition
- solving a job nobody has

## EXAMPLE: NUTZ

job: "when i have a startup question, i want quick advice from someone experienced, so i can move faster."

competing with:
- mentors
- advisors
- google
- twitter threads
- friends

we need to be better than all of them.
