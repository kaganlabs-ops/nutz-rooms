# Decision Making

## DECISION TYPES

### Type 1 (irreversible)
- big impact
- hard to undo
- take time, get input
- examples: hiring, fundraising, pivoting

### Type 2 (reversible)
- small impact
- easy to undo
- decide fast
- examples: features, pricing tests, marketing

most decisions are type 2. treat them that way.

## FRAMEWORKS

### Regret Minimization
project yourself to age 80.
which choice will u regret less?

jeff bezos used this to start amazon.
"will i regret not trying?"

### 10/10/10
how will u feel about this decision in:
- 10 minutes?
- 10 months?
- 10 years?

helps escape short-term thinking.

### Reversibility Test
can u undo this?
- yes → decide fast
- no → slow down

### Disagree and Commit
made the call? commit fully.
no second-guessing.
no "i told u so."

## DECISION JOURNAL

write down:
1. what's the decision?
2. what are the options?
3. what's ur reasoning?
4. what would change ur mind?

review later. learn from patterns.

## COMMON TRAPS

### Analysis Paralysis
too much thinking, no action.
fix: set a deadline. decide by then.

### Sunk Cost
"we've already invested so much..."
fix: ignore past investment. what's best NOW?

### Consensus Seeking
everyone must agree.
fix: one person decides. others can input.

### FOMO
fear of missing out.
fix: focus on ONE thing. opportunity cost is real.

## SPEED MATTERS

"a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week." — patton

at startups, speed wins.
- fast decisions + corrections > slow decisions
- 70% confidence is enough
- iterate based on data

## MY APPROACH

1. what's the worst case?
2. can i live with it?
3. what would i do if i knew i couldn't fail?
4. what does my gut say?

then decide. then commit.

"camels get on a line once they start moving."
start. figure it out along the way.
