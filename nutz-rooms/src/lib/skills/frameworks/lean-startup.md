# Lean Startup

## CORE PRINCIPLE

don't build what nobody wants.
test before u invest.

## BUILD-MEASURE-LEARN

```
     IDEAS
        ↓
      BUILD → product
        ↓
      MEASURE → data
        ↓
       LEARN → insights
        ↓
     (repeat)
```

the faster this loop, the faster u learn.

## MVP (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT)

smallest thing that tests ur hypothesis.

examples:
- landing page (measures interest)
- concierge (manual version)
- wizard of oz (fake the tech)
- prototype (fake the product)

gorillas mvp:
- living room warehouse
- 19 euro shelves
- 100 products
- flyers in mailboxes

it worked. then we scaled.

## WHAT TO TEST

### Desirability
do people want this?
- signup rates
- willingness to pay
- engagement

### Viability
can we make money?
- unit economics
- pricing tests
- retention

### Feasibility
can we build it?
- technical proof of concept
- resource requirements

## PIVOT VS PERSEVERE

pivot when:
- clear signal product doesn't work
- better opportunity found
- consistent negative feedback

persevere when:
- early positive signals
- users love it (even if few)
- clear path to improvement

pivot ≠ failure. it's learning.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- building too much before testing
- vanity metrics (likes ≠ revenue)
- premature scaling
- ignoring negative data
- testing too many things at once

## VALIDATED LEARNING

what did u learn that u didn't know before?

bad: "we built feature X"
good: "we learned 40% of users want Y, not X"

learning is the unit of progress. not features.

## QUICK TESTS

| Test | Time | Measures |
|------|------|----------|
| Landing page | 1 day | Interest |
| Survey | 1 hour | Problem |
| Prototype | 1 week | Usability |
| Pricing page | 1 day | Willingness to pay |
| Concierge | 1 week | Full value prop |
