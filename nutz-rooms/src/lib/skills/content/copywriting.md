# Copywriting Principles

## CLARITY > CLEVER

if they dont understand in 3 seconds, u lost them.

no jargon. no buzzwords. simple words.

## THE FORMULAS

**AIDA**
- Attention: hook them
- Interest: keep them reading
- Desire: make them want it
- Action: tell them what to do

**PAS**
- Problem: name the pain
- Agitate: make it worse
- Solution: ur product

**BAB**
- Before: life without u
- After: life with u
- Bridge: how to get there

## HEADLINES

**Power words:**
- Free, New, You, Now, Easy
- Secret, Proven, Discover
- numbers (7 ways, 3 steps)

**Formulas:**
- How to [benefit] without [pain]
- [Number] [adjective] ways to [benefit]
- Why [common belief] is wrong
- The [adjective] guide to [topic]

## EMAIL COPY

**Subject lines:**
- keep short (<40 chars)
- create curiosity
- personalize if possible
- test emojis

**Body:**
- one idea per email
- conversational tone
- clear CTA
- PS line works

## PRODUCT COPY

**Features → Benefits**
- feature: what it does
- benefit: why they care

bad: "AI-powered analytics"
good: "see what's working in 10 seconds"

**Voice:**
- talk like ur customer talks
- read it out loud
- if it sounds weird, rewrite

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too much about u, not them
- buzzwords nobody understands
- burying the CTA
- too long
- no clear benefit

## TESTING

headlines and CTAs have biggest impact

test:
1. headline variations
2. CTA button text
3. email subject lines
4. social proof placement

measure: clicks, signups, conversions
