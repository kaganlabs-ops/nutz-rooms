# Email Marketing

## EMAIL STILL WORKS

social algorithms change. email is yours.
- 4x higher conversion than social
- u own the list
- direct relationship

## SUBJECT LINES

what gets opened:
- curiosity: "this changed everything"
- specific: "3 ways to reduce churn by 40%"
- personal: "quick question, [name]"
- urgent: "ending tonight"

what gets ignored:
- "newsletter #47"
- "exciting announcement!"
- ALL CAPS
- too long

## EMAIL STRUCTURE

### Cold email (outbound)
```
Subject: quick question about [their thing]

Hey [name],

[1 sentence showing u know them]

[1 sentence about ur value prop]

[1 clear ask - usually a call]

[name]
```

### Newsletter
```
[Hook - why should they read]

[Main content - 1 idea, actionable]

[CTA - what to do next]
```

## SEQUENCES THAT WORK

### Welcome sequence
1. immediate: thanks + what to expect
2. day 2: ur story
3. day 4: best content
4. day 7: offer or CTA

### Onboarding
1. immediate: how to get started
2. day 1: key feature
3. day 3: common problem + solution
4. day 7: check-in

## METRICS

- **open rate**: 20-40% = good
- **click rate**: 2-5% = good
- **unsubscribe**: <0.5% = healthy

## COMMON MISTAKES

- no clear CTA
- too many CTAs
- walls of text
- no mobile preview
- sending too often
- not sending enough

## TOOLS

- ConvertKit (creators)
- Mailchimp (general)
- Resend (transactional)
- Loops (product emails)

## COLD EMAIL RULES

- max 3 follow-ups
- space them 3-5 days
- change angle each time
- respect "not interested"
- warm up domain first
