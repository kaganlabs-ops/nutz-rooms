# Video Scripts

## VIDEO = ATTENTION

video is the highest engagement content.
but it's hard.
script before u shoot.

## HOOK (FIRST 3 SECONDS)

u have 3 seconds before they scroll.

hooks that work:
- surprising fact
- question
- controversy
- story start
- promise result

bad hooks:
- "hey guys welcome to my channel"
- long intros
- explaining who u are

## SCRIPT STRUCTURE

### Short-form (TikTok, Reels)
```
[Hook - 3 sec]
[Problem - 5 sec]
[Solution - 15 sec]
[CTA - 3 sec]
```

### Long-form (YouTube)
```
[Hook - 30 sec]
[Intro + credibility - 1 min]
[Content - main body]
[Summary - 1 min]
[CTA - 30 sec]
```

## WRITING FOR SPOKEN WORD

- short sentences
- conversational tone
- read it out loud (does it sound natural?)
- avoid jargon
- use "you" not "one"

## VIDEO TYPES

### Tutorial
1. what we're building
2. step by step
3. show result
4. common mistakes

### Explainer
1. problem
2. why it matters
3. solution
4. how it works
5. CTA

### Story
1. setup (character + goal)
2. conflict (obstacle)
3. resolution
4. lesson

## RETENTION TRICKS

- pattern interrupts (change angle, b-roll)
- open loops ("but first...")
- timestamps in comments
- verbal signposts ("here's the key...")

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too long intro
- no structure
- monotone delivery
- no CTA
- reading instead of talking

## EQUIPMENT (START SIMPLE)

- phone camera (good enough)
- natural light
- quiet room
- lapel mic ($20)

don't buy fancy gear before u prove u'll use it.

## EDITING

- cut dead space
- add captions (80% watch muted)
- simple cuts > fancy transitions
- keep energy high

tools: CapCut (free), Descript (AI-powered)
