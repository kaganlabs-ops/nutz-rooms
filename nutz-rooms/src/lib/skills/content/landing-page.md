# Landing Page Principles

## ONE GOAL

every landing page has ONE job:
- sign up
- join waitlist
- book demo
- buy now

pick one. optimize for that.

## THE STRUCTURE

**Above the Fold (first screen)**
1. Headline — what u do in 5 words
2. Subheadline — who it's for + benefit
3. CTA button — the ONE action
4. Visual — product shot or demo

**Below the Fold**
- Social proof (logos, testimonials)
- How it works (3 steps max)
- Features → Benefits
- FAQ
- Final CTA

## HEADLINE FORMULAS

**Problem-focused:**
"Stop wasting time on [pain point]"

**Benefit-focused:**
"[Outcome] in [timeframe]"

**For who:**
"[Product] for [audience] who want [outcome]"

## EXAMPLES

**Good:**
- "Groceries in 10 minutes" (gorillas)
- "Move fast, break nothing" (linear)
- "Write better. Faster." (grammarly)

**Bad:**
- "Revolutionary AI-powered solution for..."
- "The best way to manage your..."
- "Welcome to [Company Name]"

## SOCIAL PROOF

order of credibility:
1. big logos (if u have them)
2. specific numbers ("10,000 users")
3. testimonials with faces + names
4. press mentions
5. awards/badges

## CTA BEST PRACTICES

- specific > generic ("Get free report" > "Submit")
- repeat CTA multiple times
- reduce friction (fewer form fields)
- urgency if real (limited spots)

## MOBILE

most traffic is mobile. test there first.

- big buttons (thumb-friendly)
- short copy
- fast load (<3 sec)
- single column

## TESTING

- A/B test headlines first (biggest impact)
- test CTA text
- test form length
- track: visits → signups → activation

## TOOLS

- **vercel** — deploy instantly
- **next.js** — build fast
- **tailwind** — style quick
- **hotjar** — see what users do
