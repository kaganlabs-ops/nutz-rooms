# Social Media Strategy

## PICK ONE PLATFORM

don't try to be everywhere.

| Platform | Good for |
|----------|----------|
| Twitter/X | tech, founders, real-time |
| LinkedIn | B2B, professional |
| Instagram | visual, consumer |
| TikTok | viral, young audience |
| YouTube | education, long-form |

go deep on one before expanding.

## CONTENT TYPES

### Twitter/X
- threads (educational)
- hot takes
- behind the scenes
- replies to big accounts

### LinkedIn
- story posts
- lessons learned
- contrarian takes
- career content

### Instagram
- reels (reach)
- carousels (saves)
- stories (engagement)

## WHAT WORKS

- personal stories
- specific numbers
- contrarian opinions
- useful frameworks
- behind the scenes

## WHAT DOESN'T

- generic advice
- "just launched!" posts
- only self-promotion
- corporate speak
- posting without engaging

## POSTING FREQUENCY

minimum viable:
- Twitter: 1-3x daily
- LinkedIn: 3-5x weekly
- Instagram: 1x daily
- TikTok: 1-3x daily

consistency > volume.

## GROWTH TACTICS

1. **engage before posting**: comment on others
2. **reply to big accounts**: get seen
3. **post at good times**: test ur audience
4. **repurpose content**: one idea, many formats
5. **collaborate**: guest posts, interviews

## CONTENT CALENDAR

simple version:
| Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| story | tip | thread | engage | behind scenes |

batch create on weekends.

## METRICS THAT MATTER

- engagement rate (likes+comments / impressions)
- followers (quality > quantity)
- link clicks (if selling)
- DMs (real connections)

vanity: likes on random posts.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- no bio optimization
- inconsistent posting
- only broadcasting, no engaging
- copying competitors
- expecting overnight results
