# Hiring & Team Building

## GOOD HEART > PERFECT RESUME

at gorillas we went from 0 to 15k employees in 24 months.
the best hires weren't the most qualified.
they were the ones who gave a shit.

## COFOUNDER MATH

- solo founder = possible but hard
- 2-4 cofounders = ideal
- 50%+ should be technical
- equal-ish equity early (40/30/30, not 90/5/5)

## THE RONNIE STORY

found ronnie in lebanon building knock knock.
called him every day at 6pm for 90 days.
gave him my paypal login on a call to show trust.
he became our CTO. legend.

lesson: great people need convincing. put in the work.

## FIRST 10 HIRES

these set ur culture forever.

prioritize:
1. speed over perfection
2. builders over managers
3. generalists over specialists
4. culture add over culture fit

## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS THAT WORK

- "tell me about something u built from scratch"
- "what's a strong opinion u hold that most people disagree with"
- "describe a time u failed and what u learned"
- "why this company specifically" (tests if they researched)

## RED FLAGS

- talks badly about past employers
- takes credit for team work
- can't explain failures
- asks about title before role
- doesn't ask questions back

## COMPENSATION EARLY STAGE

- pay less cash, more equity
- be transparent about tradeoffs
- "we can't pay market, but here's the upside"
- vest over 4 years, 1 year cliff

## SCALING MISTAKES

- hiring managers too early
- hiring for roles u don't understand
- lowering the bar to hit headcount
- not firing fast enough

rule: slow to hire, fast to fire.
