# Competitive Analysis

## THE TRAP

founders spend too much time on competitors.
i did this at gorillas — talked about competition constantly.
should've focused on customers and values.

## WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS

### 1. Who's Desperate for This?
forget competitors. find the customer who NEEDS this solved NOW.
- what do they use today?
- what's broken about it?
- how much pain are they in?

### 2. Why Will You Win?
not "we're better" — that's not a strategy.
- unique insight they don't have
- unfair advantage (team, tech, distribution)
- different customer segment
- different business model

## QUICK COMPETITIVE SCAN

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Who's biggest? | Shows market exists |
| Who's fastest growing? | Shows what's working |
| Who died recently? | Shows what doesn't work |
| Who's their customer? | Find gaps |
| What do users complain about? | Your opportunity |

## DIFFERENTIATION THAT WORKS

- **Speed** — gorillas did 10 min when others did 1 hr
- **Price** — only if u have cost advantage
- **Focus** — own a niche completely
- **Experience** — make it 10x easier
- **Integration** — connect what others don't

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK

- "we're like X but better" (not defensible)
- "we have more features" (features are copied)
- "we're cheaper" (race to bottom)
- "better customer service" (everyone says this)

## COMPETITOR TRACKING

check monthly, not daily:
- their pricing changes
- their funding announcements
- their key hires
- user reviews (what's broken)

then get back to building.
