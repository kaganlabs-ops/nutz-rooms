# Pitch Deck Principles

## STORY FIRST, DATA SUPPORTS

investors hear 100 pitches a week. they remember stories.

lead with:
1. why u — personal connection to the problem
2. the aha moment — what made u start this
3. early traction story — not just numbers, the HOW

## THE 10 SLIDES THAT MATTER

1. **Title** — name, tagline, ur face
2. **Problem** — who has it, how bad (make them feel it)
3. **Solution** — simple, not features
4. **Why now** — timing matters more than idea
5. **Market** — TAM is bullshit, show ur wedge
6. **Traction** — growth rate > absolute numbers
7. **Business model** — how u make money (keep it simple)
8. **Team** — why u specifically can win this
9. **Ask** — how much, what for, milestones
10. **Vision** — where this goes (dream big here)

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too many slides (10-12 max)
- features not benefits
- TAM = "trillion dollar market" 🙄
- no clear ask
- reading the slides
- no story about WHY them

## GORILLAS EXAMPLE

when i pitched gorillas i opened with:
"my wife sent me grocery shopping. i stood in line 20 min. i thought... this sucks. then pandemic hit."

that story got us meetings. the data closed them.

## DESIGN TIPS

- one idea per slide
- big text, less words
- images > text
- consistent colors
- ur face somewhere (trust)
