# Investor Relations

## BEFORE U RAISE

### Build Relationships Early
- meet investors 12-18 months before raising
- share updates (monthly email)
- ask for advice, not money
- when u raise, they already know u

### Easier to Raise When U Don't Need It
paradox: investors want to invest when u don't need them.
- raise when metrics are up
- raise when u have runway
- desperation = bad terms

## THE RAISE PROCESS

1. **Target list**: 50-100 investors
2. **Warm intros**: 80% better than cold
3. **First meeting**: story + traction
4. **Partner meeting**: deep dive
5. **Term sheet**: negotiate
6. **Due diligence**: 2-4 weeks
7. **Close**: wire money

## INVESTOR UPDATES

send monthly. even when it's bad.

format:
```
SUBJECT: [Company] - Jan Update

HIGHLIGHTS (3 bullets)
- MRR: $X (+Y%)
- Key win: [thing]
- Challenge: [thing]

METRICS TABLE
[revenue, users, burn, runway]

ASK
[specific help needed]
```

bad news in an update > surprise on a board call.

## GORILLAS FUNDRAISE

raised 1 billion in a single round.
that year germany invested 300M total in startups.

what worked:
- growth story (10-20% WoW)
- timing (pandemic)
- fomo (multiple term sheets)

what i'd do differently:
- take less money
- pick partners not just price

## TERM SHEET BASICS

watch for:
- **valuation** (pre vs post money)
- **liquidation preference** (1x non-participating = fair)
- **board seats** (keep control early)
- **anti-dilution** (broad-based weighted average)
- **option pool** (comes from ur ownership)

## MANAGING THE BOARD

- no surprises. ever.
- send materials 48hrs before
- come with decisions, not questions
- ask for specific help
- follow up on commitments
