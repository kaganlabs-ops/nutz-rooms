# Go-to-Market Principles

## FIND DESPERATE USERS FIRST

"everyone is customer" = nobody is customer

find people who NEED this. not want. NEED.

signs of desperation:
- they're already hacking together solutions
- they complain about this problem constantly
- they'd pay anything for a fix
- the problem costs them real money/time

## WHERE TO FIND THEM

**Communities**
- reddit, discord, slack groups
- twitter/X communities
- facebook groups (yes still)
- industry forums

**Direct Outreach**
- linkedin (if B2B)
- cold email (10% response if good)
- warm intros always better

**Content**
- SEO takes time but compounds
- twitter/X for visibility
- youtube for trust
- podcasts for reach

## THE GORILLAS PLAYBOOK

i literally put flyers in mailboxes. 10% conversion.

not scalable. but told me WHO cared.

then:
- word of mouth (best channel)
- instagram ads (targeted by location)
- referral program (both sides get €5)
- partnerships (local businesses)

## SCALING CHANNELS

start with 1 channel. master it. then add.

typical progression:
1. founder doing sales/outreach
2. paid acquisition (test quickly)
3. content/SEO (build over time)
4. partnerships (after you have leverage)
5. brand (when you're big)

## METRICS THAT MATTER

- CAC (customer acquisition cost)
- conversion rate at each step
- payback period
- channel-specific LTV
- viral coefficient (if applicable)

## COMMON MISTAKES

- spending on brand before product-market fit
- trying all channels at once
- not tracking properly
- giving up too early on a channel
- not talking to customers directly

## LAUNCH VS GROW

**Launch** = get attention once
- product hunt, hacker news, press
- spike of users
- good for validation

**Grow** = sustainable acquisition
- repeatable, scalable channels
- what actually builds a business
