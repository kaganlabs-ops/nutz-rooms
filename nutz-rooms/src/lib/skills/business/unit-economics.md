# Unit Economics

## THE ONLY MATH THAT MATTERS

**LTV > CAC** (ideally 3x+)

- LTV = how much a customer pays over their lifetime
- CAC = how much it costs to get that customer

if LTV < CAC, u lose money on every customer. more customers = more losses.

## CALCULATING LTV

Simple version:
```
LTV = (Average Revenue per Month) × (Average Customer Lifetime in Months)
```

Example:
- $50/mo × 24 months = $1,200 LTV

## CALCULATING CAC

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired
```

Example:
- Spent $10,000 on ads
- Got 100 customers
- CAC = $100

## THE RATIOS

| Ratio | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| LTV:CAC = 1:1 | Break even (bad) |
| LTV:CAC = 3:1 | Healthy |
| LTV:CAC = 5:1 | Either great or under-investing in growth |

## PAYBACK PERIOD

how many months to recover CAC?

```
Payback = CAC / Monthly Revenue per Customer
```

- < 6 months = great
- 6-12 months = okay
- > 12 months = cash flow problem

## GORILLAS REALITY

we burned 760M by summer 2022. unit economics were brutal:
- high CAC (ads, discounts)
- low margins (groceries = 2-3%)
- high fulfillment cost (riders, warehouses)

lesson: know ur numbers BEFORE scaling.

## RED FLAGS

- CAC increasing over time
- LTV decreasing (churn problem)
- gross margin < 50% for software
- gross margin < 20% for physical goods
- payback > 18 months

## FIX BAD UNIT ECONOMICS

1. **Reduce CAC**: referrals, organic, better targeting
2. **Increase LTV**: reduce churn, upsell, price increase
3. **Improve margins**: cut costs, raise prices
4. **Change model**: different customer, different product
