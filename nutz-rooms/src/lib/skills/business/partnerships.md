# Partnerships & BD

## PARTNERSHIPS ARE DISTRACTING

most partnership discussions = waste of time.
big companies say "let's partner" but mean "let's talk for 6 months then maybe do a pilot."

## WHEN PARTNERSHIPS WORK

1. **Distribution**: they have customers u want
2. **Credibility**: their name opens doors
3. **Integration**: ur products work better together
4. **Resources**: they have something u can't build

## WHEN TO AVOID

- "we should explore synergies"
- "let's do a pilot" (with no budget)
- requires changing ur product
- takes founder time with no clear ROI
- they want equity for introductions

## PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE

### Revenue Share
- u sell, they get %
- or they sell, u get %
- clear attribution matters

### Integration
- API access
- co-marketing
- joint customers

### Reseller
- they sell ur product
- u give them margin
- they handle support (or not)

## NEGOTIATING

what they want:
- revenue
- good look to their customers
- minimal work

what u want:
- distribution
- credibility
- revenue

find the overlap. don't need to be equal — just need to both win.

## PARTNERSHIP CHECKLIST

before committing:
- [ ] clear ROI for both sides
- [ ] specific timeline
- [ ] specific metrics
- [ ] named owner on both sides
- [ ] exit clause if not working

## COMMON MISTAKES

- spending 6 months on one partnership
- no clear owner
- "let's see how it goes" metrics
- giving too much for too little
- partnership instead of selling direct

## GORILLAS PARTNERSHIPS

we partnered with brands for exclusive products.
worked because:
- clear value (distribution for them, margin for us)
- fast execution
- measurable results

didn't work:
- vague "strategic" discussions
- partnerships that required us to change operations
