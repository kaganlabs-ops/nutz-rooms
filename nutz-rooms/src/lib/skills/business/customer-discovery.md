# Customer Discovery

## I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG

first week at gorillas, i thought i knew everything.
talked to 10 people. completely wrong.

u don't know ur customer. go find out.

## THE MOM TEST

don't ask: "do u think this is a good idea?"
(everyone says yes to be nice)

ask:
- "tell me about the last time u had this problem"
- "what did u do about it?"
- "how much did that cost u?"
- "what else have u tried?"

past behavior > future promises.

## WHO TO TALK TO

### Early Users (find 10)
- who has this problem BADLY?
- who's already hacking together solutions?
- who would pay TODAY?

### Not Early Users
- people who say "sounds interesting"
- people who want it free
- people who want features u don't have

## INTERVIEW STRUCTURE

1. **Context** (2 min): what do u do? day in ur life?
2. **Problem** (10 min): tell me about [problem area]
3. **Current solutions** (5 min): what do u use now?
4. **Pain points** (5 min): what's broken?
5. **Willingness to pay** (3 min): would u pay? how much?

## SIGNALS THAT MATTER

strong signals:
- "i would pay for that today"
- "can i be first to use it?"
- "i spent X hours/dollars on this problem"
- pulls out credit card

weak signals:
- "that's interesting"
- "my friend would love this"
- "let me know when it's ready"

## THE FLYERS TEST

at gorillas, i put flyers in mailboxes.
10% came back and ordered.
that's when i knew it was real.

get people to DO something, not just talk.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- building before talking
- talking to friends (biased)
- leading questions
- too small sample (need 20-30)
- ignoring negative feedback
