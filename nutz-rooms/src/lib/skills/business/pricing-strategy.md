# Pricing Strategy

## CHARGE FROM DAY 1

free users are not customers. they're just traffic.

the moment someone pays, u learn:
- do they actually need this?
- what's it worth to them?
- will they stick around?

## PRICING FRAMEWORKS

### Value-Based Pricing
what's the pain worth to them?
- if u save them 10 hrs/month and their time = $100/hr → ur worth $1000/mo
- price at 10-20% of value created

### Competitor-Based
- 10% cheaper = commodity (bad)
- same price, better product = good
- 2-3x more expensive = premium positioning

### Cost-Plus (avoid this)
cost + margin = race to bottom

## COMMON MISTAKES

- pricing too low (u attract wrong customers)
- too many tiers (confusing)
- free tier too generous (no reason to upgrade)
- annual discount too steep (cash flow problems)

## THE 10X RULE

ur product should deliver 10x the value of the price.
- $100/mo product should save $1000/mo
- if u cant make this math work, the product isnt ready

## TESTING PRICES

1. start higher than u think
2. if no pushback, raise again
3. when 20% of people say "too expensive" → ur close
4. never lower prices publicly (discount privately)

## GORILLAS LESSON

we started with free delivery over 25 euros. then 10 euros. people paid more for speed than free.

lesson: convenience > price for the right customer.
