# Business Model Principles

## START SIMPLE

pick ONE way to make money first. you can add more later.

most startups overcomplicate this. keep it stupid simple.

## COMMON MODELS

**Subscription (SaaS)**
- monthly/annual fee
- predictable revenue
- churn is the enemy
- works for: tools, platforms, services

**Transaction/Marketplace**
- take % of each sale
- need volume
- chicken-egg problem
- works for: marketplaces, payments

**Freemium**
- free tier + paid upgrade
- conversion rate matters (2-5% typical)
- works for: consumer apps, dev tools

**Direct Sales**
- sell directly to businesses
- higher prices, longer cycles
- works for: enterprise, complex products

## WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS

**Unit Economics**
- LTV (lifetime value) > 3x CAC (customer acquisition cost)
- payback period < 12 months
- gross margin > 60% for software

**Pricing**
- charge more than u think
- value-based, not cost-based
- test different prices
- enterprise pays 10x more for same thing

## GORILLAS MODEL

simple: delivery fee + margin on products
- €1.80 delivery fee
- ~25% margin on groceries
- average order €25-30
- 3+ orders/month per active user

kept adding: subscriptions, partnerships, ads later. but started simple.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- free for too long
- pricing too low
- too many pricing tiers
- ignoring unit economics
- not testing prices

## QUESTIONS TO ASK

1. who pays? (user vs business)
2. when do they pay? (upfront vs usage)
3. how much value do u create? (price = % of that)
4. what's the competition charging?
5. what's the switching cost?
