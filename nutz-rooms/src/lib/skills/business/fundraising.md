# Fundraising Principles

## WHEN TO RAISE

raise when u DONT need to. desperation = bad terms.

best time: after clear traction signal
- users growing 10%+ week over week
- revenue doubling quarter over quarter
- waitlist exploding
- press/word of mouth happening

## HOW MUCH TO RAISE

formula: 18-24 months runway to next milestone

pre-seed: $500k-$1.5M (idea + team + early signal)
seed: $1.5M-$4M (product + initial traction)
series A: $8M-$15M (product-market fit + scaling)

## THE PROCESS

1. **warm intros only** — cold emails = 2% response
2. **batch meetings** — create FOMO
3. **lead investor first** — others follow
4. **move fast** — momentum matters
5. **always be fundraising** — relationships take time

## WHAT VCs LOOK FOR

- team (can u execute?)
- market (is it big enough?)
- traction (is it working?)
- timing (why now?)
- differentiation (why u win?)

## MY GORILLAS FUNDRAISE

raised 1B in single round when others raised 300M total that year.

how:
- showed 10-20% week over week growth
- had clear "why now" (pandemic)
- vision was massive (change how cities work)
- moved FAST — term sheet to close in 2 weeks

## NEGOTIATION TIPS

- valuation matters less than terms
- watch for liquidation preferences
- keep board small early
- dont give up too much control
- pro-rata rights matter

## RED FLAGS IN INVESTORS

- too many questions, no conviction
- want to "watch for a few months"
- weird terms
- bad reputation with founders
- no relevant experience
