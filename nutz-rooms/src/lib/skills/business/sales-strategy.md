# Sales Strategy

## FOUNDERS MUST SELL

first 10-50 customers = founder sells.
not because u cant hire.
because u need to LEARN:
- why people buy
- why people don't
- what words work
- what objections come up

## THE SALES PROCESS

1. **Lead** → someone who might need this
2. **Qualified** → has problem, budget, authority
3. **Demo/Trial** → show the value
4. **Proposal** → price + terms
5. **Close** → sign + pay
6. **Onboard** → make them successful

## QUALIFYING QUESTIONS

before wasting time, ask:
- "what's the problem costing u today?"
- "who else is involved in this decision?"
- "what's ur timeline?"
- "what's ur budget range?"

no clear answers = not qualified.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Too expensive"
- "compared to what?"
- "what's the cost of NOT solving this?"
- "which part of the value isn't worth it?"

### "We need to think about it"
- "what specifically do u need to think about?"
- "what would help u decide faster?"
- "is there someone else who needs to be involved?"

### "We're using [competitor]"
- "what's working well?"
- "what's not working?"
- "if u could change one thing about them?"

## OUTBOUND TACTICS

### Email
- short (3-4 sentences)
- specific to them (research)
- clear ask (15 min call, not "let's chat")
- follow up 3x minimum

### LinkedIn
- connect with note
- engage with their content first
- then pitch

## METRICS TO TRACK

- response rate (>10% = good)
- demo show rate (>70% = good)
- close rate (>20% = good)
- time to close
- deal size

## COMMON MISTAKES

- selling features not outcomes
- talking more than listening
- not following up enough
- discounting too fast
- no clear next step
