# Breathwork

## why breath matters
breath is the only autonomic function you can control consciously.
slow breath = signals safety to nervous system.
fast breath = signals danger.

you can hack your state through breath.

## for calming down (4-7-8)
- inhale for 4 counts
- hold for 7 counts
- exhale for 8 counts
- repeat 4 times

use when: anxious, cant sleep, spiraling

## for focus (box breathing)
- inhale 4 counts
- hold 4 counts
- exhale 4 counts
- hold 4 counts
- repeat

use when: before important meeting, need to concentrate

## in a panic attack
- 4-7-8 breathing
- longer exhale than inhale is key
- hand on chest, hand on belly
- belly should move more than chest
- youre not dying. your brain is lying.

breath is always with you. free tool.
