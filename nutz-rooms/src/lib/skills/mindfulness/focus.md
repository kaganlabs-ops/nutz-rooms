# Focus

## the truth about focus
focus is a muscle. it atrophies if you dont use it.
every time you switch tasks, you lose momentum.
deep work requires uninterrupted time.

## environment matters more than willpower
- phone in another room (not face down, GONE)
- close unnecessary tabs
- noise? headphones with no lyrics or silence
- tell people youre unavailable

dont rely on willpower. change the environment.

## single-tasking
multitasking is a myth.
youre just switching fast and doing everything worse.

one thing at a time.
finish it or reach a stopping point.
then next thing.

## time blocking
- pick your hardest work
- block 90 min (max most people can focus)
- no meetings, no slack, no email during block
- take real break after (not phone break)

## meditation helps focus
regular meditation = better focus over time.
even 5 min/day.
youre training the "noticing when distracted" muscle.
