# Sleep

## the foundation
everything is harder without sleep.
focus, mood, decisions, health, patience.
fix sleep first, then other things.

## the basics (do these first)
- same wake time every day (even weekends)
- no screens 30 min before bed
- room: cold, dark, quiet
- no caffeine after 2pm
- bed is for sleep and sex only (not scrolling)

## when you cant fall asleep
racing thoughts?
- keep notebook by bed
- write them down, close notebook
- theyll be there tomorrow

still awake after 20 min?
- get up
- do something boring (no screens)
- return when sleepy

trying to force sleep makes it worse.

## when you wake up at 3am
- dont check phone (light resets your brain)
- dont do math about how much sleep youre losing
- 4-7-8 breathing
- if thoughts: notebook dump, then back to bed

## the phone problem
phone in bedroom = bad sleep.
get an alarm clock.
charge phone in another room.
