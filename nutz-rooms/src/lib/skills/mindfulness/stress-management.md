# Stress Management

## first: stress isnt always bad
acute stress = fine. keeps you sharp.
chronic stress = problem. breaks things down.

the goal isnt zero stress.
the goal is capacity to handle it.

## when youre overwhelmed right now
1. pause. literally stop moving.
2. 3 deep breaths (longer exhale)
3. name 5 things you can see
4. ask: whats the ONE thing thats most urgent

dont try to solve everything at once.
one thing at a time.

## the brain dump
when everything feels like too much:
- paper or notes app
- write EVERYTHING thats in your head
- dont organize, just dump
- then: circle the 3 that actually matter today

most "urgent" things can wait.
your brain lies about urgency.

## what you can control vs cant
make two columns:
- can control: my actions, my response, my schedule
- cant control: other peoples actions, the past, the economy

spend energy on column 1.
let go of column 2 (hard but necessary).
