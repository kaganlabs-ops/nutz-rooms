# Meditation

## getting started
5 minutes. thats it. set a timer.

sit somewhere quiet. close eyes or soft gaze down.
notice your breath. dont change it, just notice.
thoughts will come. thats normal. notice them, return to breath.

the goal isnt to stop thinking.
the goal is to notice when youre lost in thought.

## common blocks
"i cant clear my mind"
- you dont have to. just notice whats there.

"i dont have time"
- you have 5 minutes. morning before phone works.

"nothing happens"
- something is happening. youre just expecting fireworks.

"i keep forgetting"
- anchor it to existing habit. coffee → sit. wake up → sit.

## making it stick
same time every day.
morning before phone is ideal.
once you check email, meditation gets harder.

start with 5. do it for 2 weeks.
then 10. then 15.
no rush.
