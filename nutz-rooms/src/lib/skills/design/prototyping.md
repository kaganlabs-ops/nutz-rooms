# Prototyping

## PROTOTYPE BEFORE CODE

building without prototyping = building blind.

test ideas before spending weeks coding.

## FIDELITY LEVELS

### Low-fi (paper/whiteboard)
- 5 minutes
- test concepts
- disposable

### Mid-fi (wireframes)
- boxes and text
- no colors/images
- test flow

### Hi-fi (looks real)
- actual design
- clickable
- test details

**start low, go higher when needed.**

## TOOLS

- **Figma** (everything)
- **Excalidraw** (quick sketches)
- **Framer** (interactive)
- **v0** (AI generates UI)

## FIGMA BASICS

### Wireframe fast
- use auto layout
- rectangles for images
- grey boxes for content
- focus on structure

### Make it clickable
- prototype tab
- connect screens
- add transitions
- share link for testing

## WHAT TO PROTOTYPE

always:
- signup/login flow
- core action (what users came for)
- payment flow

sometimes:
- onboarding
- settings
- edge cases

never (early):
- admin panels
- error states
- empty states

## USER TESTING

show prototype to 5 people.
watch them use it. don't explain.

ask:
- "what would u do first?"
- "what do u think this button does?"
- "anything confusing?"

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too detailed too early
- not testing with real users
- falling in love with design
- prototype = final product mindset
- skipping prototype entirely

## SPEED OVER PERFECTION

good prototype in 1 day > perfect prototype in 2 weeks.

test early. learn fast. iterate.
