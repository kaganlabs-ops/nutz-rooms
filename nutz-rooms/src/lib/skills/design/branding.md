# Branding

## BRAND ≠ LOGO

brand = how people feel about u.
logo = a small part of that.

focus on:
1. what u stand for
2. how u communicate
3. consistency

## BRAND FOUNDATIONS

### Name
- easy to spell
- easy to say
- domain available
- not taken on social

### Tagline
one sentence = what u do + why it matters.
- bad: "innovative solutions for modern problems"
- good: "groceries in 10 minutes"

### Values
3-5 things u actually care about.
not corporate fluff.
things that guide decisions.

## VISUAL IDENTITY

### Colors
- 1 primary (recognition)
- 1-2 secondary (support)
- 1 accent (CTAs)
- neutrals (text, bg)

gorillas: purple + yellow = memorable.

### Typography
- 1 heading font (personality)
- 1 body font (readable)
- that's it.

### Logo
- works at small sizes
- works in black/white
- simple enough to remember
- doesn't need explanation

## VOICE & TONE

how u talk:
- formal vs casual
- serious vs playful
- technical vs simple

be consistent everywhere:
- website
- emails
- support
- social

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too many colors
- trendy fonts that age badly
- inconsistent across channels
- copying competitors
- changing too often

## QUICK BRAND KIT

tools:
- Figma (design)
- Coolors (colors)
- Google Fonts (free fonts)
- Noun Project (icons)

don't spend months on branding early.
get something good enough, ship.
