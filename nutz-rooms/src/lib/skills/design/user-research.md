# User Research

## STOP GUESSING

"i think users want..." = dangerous.

talk to users. watch them. learn.

## RESEARCH TYPES

### Generative (discovery)
- who are the users?
- what problems do they have?
- how do they solve it today?

do this BEFORE building.

### Evaluative (testing)
- does our solution work?
- can they complete tasks?
- what's confusing?

do this WHILE building.

## USER INTERVIEWS

### Structure (30 min)
1. intro + warm up (2 min)
2. context questions (5 min)
3. problem exploration (15 min)
4. solution feedback (if any) (5 min)
5. wrap up (3 min)

### Good questions
- "walk me through the last time u..."
- "what was the hardest part?"
- "what did u try?"
- "what would make that easier?"

### Bad questions
- "would u use this?"
- "is this a good idea?"
- "do u like this?"

## USABILITY TESTING

### Setup
- prototype or live product
- 5 users minimum
- tasks to complete
- screen recording

### Script
"I'd like u to [task]. think out loud as u go. there are no wrong answers — we're testing the design, not u."

### Watch for
- hesitation
- wrong clicks
- confusion
- workarounds
- frustration

## QUICK METHODS

| Method | Time | When |
|--------|------|------|
| Hallway test | 5 min | quick feedback |
| User interview | 30 min | understanding |
| Usability test | 30 min | validation |
| Survey | async | quantitative |

## COMMON MISTAKES

- leading questions
- only positive feedback
- not enough users (min 5)
- friends/family bias
- ignoring negative feedback

## ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS

after research:
1. list all findings
2. group by theme
3. prioritize by impact
4. turn into actions
5. share with team

research without action = waste of time.
