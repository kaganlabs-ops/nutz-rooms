# UI/UX Principles

## SIMPLE > CLEVER

if user has to think, u failed.

best interfaces feel invisible.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

**1. One Primary Action Per Screen**
- what do u want them to do?
- make that obvious
- everything else secondary

**2. Reduce Cognitive Load**
- less choices = more action
- progressive disclosure
- smart defaults

**3. Visual Hierarchy**
- big = important
- contrast draws attention
- whitespace is ur friend

**4. Consistency**
- same action = same look
- patterns users already know
- dont reinvent the wheel

## MOBILE FIRST

most users are mobile. design for that first.

- touch targets min 44px
- thumb-friendly navigation
- fast load times
- works offline if possible

## DESIGN PROCESS (FAST)

1. **sketch** — paper, 5 min
2. **wireframe** — boxes and lines
3. **prototype** — clickable mockup
4. **test** — show 3 people
5. **build** — simplest version

dont spend weeks in figma. ship and learn.

## TOOLS

- **figma** — design + prototype
- **shadcn/ui** — pre-built components
- **tailwind** — utility CSS
- **heroicons** — icons

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too many options
- unclear CTAs
- inconsistent styling
- tiny touch targets
- slow load times
- ignoring mobile

## DESIGN SYSTEMS (LATER)

only build a design system when u have:
- multiple products
- team of designers
- consistent patterns emerging

until then: use existing component libraries

## TESTING

- watch 3 people use it
- shut up while they try
- note where they get stuck
- fix the obvious stuff

no fancy tools needed. just watch.
