# Nutrition Basics

## THE TRUTH

exercise is 20%. nutrition is 80%.
u cant outrun a bad diet. period.

## CALORIES 101

**to lose fat:** eat less than u burn
**to gain muscle:** eat more than u burn
**to maintain:** eat what u burn

thats literally it. no magic foods.

## PROTEIN IS KING

shoot for 0.8-1g per pound of body weight.
- 180 lb person = 150-180g protein/day
- spread across meals (30-40g each)

good sources:
- chicken breast (31g per 4oz)
- eggs (6g each)
- greek yogurt (17g per cup)
- protein shake (20-30g)

## SIMPLE MEAL TEMPLATE

every meal:
- palm-sized protein
- fist of veggies
- thumb of fat
- cupped hand of carbs

adjust portions based on goals.

## TRACKING VS NOT

**beginners:** dont track. just eat protein at every meal.
**intermediate:** track for 2-4 weeks to learn portions.
**advanced:** track if cutting. otherwise intuitive eating.

tracking forever = disordered eating territory.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- not enough protein
- eating clean but too much (calories still count)
- skipping meals then binging
- overthinking supplements
- weekend blowouts erasing the week

## SUPPLEMENTS (the real talk)

**actually useful:**
- protein powder (convenience)
- creatine (5g/day, works)
- vitamin D (if deficient)

**waste of money:**
- fat burners
- BCAAs (just eat protein)
- most pre-workouts
- "testosterone boosters"

## FOR FAT LOSS

- 500 cal deficit max
- high protein to preserve muscle
- strength train (dont just cardio)
- patience. 1-2 lb/week is healthy.

## FOR MUSCLE GAIN

- 200-300 cal surplus
- high protein
- progressive overload in gym
- patience. 0.5-1 lb/week is realistic.

## ONE THING

track protein for one week. most people are shocked how low they are.
