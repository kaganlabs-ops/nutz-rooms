# Workout Programming

## THE BASICS

consistency > intensity. every time.
3x/week beats 6x/week if u actually show up.

## BEGINNER PROGRAMMING (0-6 months)

full body 3x/week. period.

**monday/wednesday/friday:**
- squat 3x8
- bench 3x8
- row 3x8
- deadlift 1x5 (fridays only)

thats it. no 47 exercises. no arm day.

## INTERMEDIATE PROGRAMMING (6+ months)

upper/lower split works best:
- upper monday/thursday
- lower tuesday/friday

**upper days:**
- bench or press 4x6
- row 4x8
- incline db 3x10
- face pulls 3x15

**lower days:**
- squat 4x6
- rdl 3x10
- leg press 3x12
- leg curl 3x12

## PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD

the ONLY way to get stronger:
1. add weight when u hit all reps
2. add 5lb for upper, 10lb for lower
3. if u fail, stay at same weight
4. deload every 6-8 weeks (drop weight 40%)

no overload = no progress. track your lifts.

## COMMON MISTAKES

- too many exercises (pick 4-6)
- no progression plan
- skipping legs (dont be that guy)
- changing programs every 2 weeks
- not tracking anything

## REST TIMES

- compound lifts: 2-3 min
- accessory work: 60-90 sec
- dont rush. rest matters.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK

- how many days can u ACTUALLY train?
- what equipment do u have?
- any injuries or limitations?
- whats ur main goal? (strength vs size vs general fitness)

## ONE THING

start with 3 days. full body. 4 exercises each.
master those before adding anything.
