# Recovery

## THE TRUTH

u dont get stronger in the gym.
u get stronger RECOVERING from the gym.

training breaks u down. recovery builds u up.

## SLEEP IS #1

7-8 hours minimum. non-negotiable.

sleep is when:
- muscle protein synthesis peaks
- growth hormone releases
- nervous system recovers

5 hours of sleep = wasted workout.

## SLEEP HYGIENE

- same bedtime every night
- room cold and dark
- no screens 30 min before bed
- no caffeine after 2pm
- no alcohol (ruins sleep quality)

## REST DAYS

**beginners:** 2-3 rest days/week
**intermediate:** 2 rest days/week
**advanced:** 1-2 rest days/week

rest day = recovery. not lazy.

## ACTIVE RECOVERY

light movement helps:
- 20-30 min walk
- easy swim
- yoga or stretching
- foam rolling

NOT another hard workout.

## SORENESS (DOMS)

delayed onset muscle soreness is normal.
- peaks 24-72 hours after training
- doesnt mean good workout
- training through mild soreness = fine
- sharp pain = stop

## OVERTRAINING SIGNS

- strength going down (not up)
- always tired
- mood changes / irritability
- getting sick often
- sleep problems
- loss of appetite
- injuries piling up

fix: deload week (50% volume) or full week off.

## DELOAD WEEKS

every 6-8 weeks:
- same exercises
- 50% of normal weight
- feels too easy = youre doing it right

this is NOT weakness. this is smart.

## NUTRITION FOR RECOVERY

- protein after workout (30-40g)
- carbs to replenish glycogen
- hydration (half ur body weight in oz)

## STRETCHING VS MOBILITY

**static stretching:** after workout, not before
**dynamic warmup:** before workout
**mobility work:** anytime, especially rest days

## ONE THING

track ur sleep for a week.
bet its less than u think.
thats ur first fix.
