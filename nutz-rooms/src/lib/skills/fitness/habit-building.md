# Fitness Habit Building

## THE HARD TRUTH

motivation is garbage. it comes and goes.
discipline = doing it when u dont feel like it.

u dont need motivation. u need systems.

## START STUPID SMALL

"im gonna go to the gym 6 days a week"
no ur not. not if ur starting from zero.

**instead:**
- week 1: go to gym, do one exercise, leave
- week 2: do two exercises
- week 3: three exercises
- build from there

the goal is SHOWING UP. not crushing it.

## HABIT STACKING

attach new habit to existing one:
- after morning coffee → 10 pushups
- before shower → 5 min stretch
- after work → gym (no going home first)

## REMOVE FRICTION

make it easy to do the right thing:
- gym bag packed night before
- gym clothes by the bed
- workout planned (no thinking)
- gym on the way to/from work

## ADD FRICTION TO BAD HABITS

make it hard to skip:
- tell someone ur going
- pay for a trainer (accountability)
- put gym shoes by the door
- delete food delivery apps

## THE TWO DAY RULE

never miss twice in a row.
missed monday? fine. tuesday is non-negotiable.
two misses = start of a new bad habit.

## PROGRESS TRACKING

- take photos monthly
- track lifts (numbers dont lie)
- notice non-scale wins (energy, sleep, mood)

scale weight fluctuates. dont obsess.

## WHEN MOTIVATION DIES

it will. heres what to do:
1. remember why u started
2. lower the bar (just show up)
3. find a workout buddy
4. change the routine (same goal, different path)

## COMMON TRAPS

- "ill start monday" (start now, even small)
- "i need the perfect plan" (any plan > no plan)
- "i dont have time" (u have time for netflix)
- "im not seeing results" (give it 12 weeks minimum)

## ONE THING

commit to 2 days/week for 4 weeks.
thats it. just show up twice a week.
build from there.
