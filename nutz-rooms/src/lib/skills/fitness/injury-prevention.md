# Injury Prevention

## THE RULES

form > weight. every. single. time.
ego lifting = injury waiting to happen.

## WARMING UP (properly)

**not warmup:**
- 5 min on treadmill
- static stretching

**actual warmup:**
- 5 min light cardio (get blood flowing)
- dynamic movements (arm circles, leg swings)
- warmup sets (50% → 70% → 85% of working weight)

## THE BIG MISTAKES

1. **too much too fast**
   - increase weight max 10% per week
   - new exercise = light weight first

2. **bad form under fatigue**
   - last rep form = first rep form
   - if form breaks, stop the set

3. **skipping warmup**
   - cold muscles tear
   - always warm up. no exceptions.

4. **ignoring pain**
   - soreness = ok
   - sharp pain = stop immediately
   - "pushing through" = stupid

## COMMON INJURY CAUSES

- **shoulders:** too much pressing, not enough pulling
- **lower back:** rounding during deadlifts/squats
- **knees:** knees caving on squats
- **elbows:** too much volume, bad bench form

## BALANCED PROGRAMMING

for every push, do a pull:
- bench press → row
- overhead press → pullup
- most people: 2 pulls for every 1 push

## MOBILITY WORK

spend 10 min daily:
- hip flexors (sitting kills these)
- thoracic spine (upper back)
- ankles (for squats)
- shoulders (band work)

## WHEN TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL

- pain lasting more than a week
- swelling or bruising
- cant do daily activities
- something feels "off"

PT or sports doc. not me. i can help after.

## COMING BACK FROM INJURY

- start at 50% of previous weight
- rebuild slowly
- ego check at the door
- if it hurts, stop

rushing back = re-injury. seen it 100 times.

## RED FLAGS (stop immediately)

- sharp/shooting pain
- numbness or tingling
- joint instability
- hearing a "pop"

## ONE THING

film ur lifts occasionally.
what feels right often looks wrong.
form check = injury prevention.
